# YakYik

A YikYak if instead of being hyperlocal Reddit, it was just a hyperlocal chatroom.

Purely just a project to work on an end-to-end publishing something to Android/iOS app store.

# Installation

Being built with Expo, this project requires the latest `expo-cli` with `npm install -g expo-cli`

```
git clone https://github.com/actuallydan/yak-yik.git
npm install
```

To run the project on the iOS Simulator, XCode and the Additional Tools must be installed (pretty sure expo will scream about this when trying to run it).

To run the application

```
npm start
```

Press `i` to open, install, and run the dev application in XCode Simulator
Press `a` to open, install, and run in Android Emulator (must install Android Studio and run AVD)
Press `w` to run in browser, but probably not great, since this is supposed to be mobile only for simplicity?
